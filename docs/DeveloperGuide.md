## Design
NextStep's architecture consists of the following few components:
- ```UI```: Responsible for user interactions, handles output to the user.
- ```Parser```: Interprets and executes user command.
- ```Commands```: Perform specific operations. *(eg. AddCommand, DeleteCommand)*
- ```Core```: Maintains current data state of NextStep.
- ```Storage```: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

# NextStep Architecture Overview

The **NextStep Architecture** is designed to efficiently manage internship-related data while maintaining modularity and scalability. It consists of several key components that work together to process user commands, store and retrieve data, and present results in a user-friendly manner. The main components of this system include **NextStep (Main), Core (InternshipList & Internship), UI, Storage, Parser, and Commands.**

## 1. NextStep (Main Component)

The **NextStep component** serves as the central hub of the system, coordinating interactions between different modules. It ensures that commands are processed correctly, and data is stored, retrieved, and displayed effectively.

### Responsibilities:
- Acts as the main entry point for user interactions.
- Directs requests to the appropriate components (Parser, Storage, UI, and InternshipList).
- Ensures smooth execution of user commands.

## 2. Core (InternshipList & Internship)

The **Core** package contains the core data model, which consists of **InternshipList** and **Internship**. The **InternshipList** serves as the container for storing multiple internship data entries, while **Internship** represents individual internship records.

### Responsibilities:
- **InternshipList**: Stores all internship data.
- **Internship**: Represents individual internship details, such as job role, company, and description.

## 3. UI (User Interface)

The **UI** package is responsible for interacting with the user. It displays information such as internship data, command results, and error messages. The UI acts as the front-end interface that communicates with the backend logic to display the processed data to the user.

### Responsibilities:
- Handles user interactions.
- Displays internship data and the results of executed commands.
- Provides a responsive and intuitive interface for the user.

## 4. Storage (StorageComponent)

The **StorageComponent** handles the persistence of data. It ensures that internship data is saved to a storage system and can be retrieved later when needed.

### Responsibilities:
- Saves and loads internship data to ensure persistence.
- Handles the storage of data when the application is closed or restarted.

## 5. Parser (ParserComponent)

The **ParserComponent** is responsible for processing user input. It reads and interprets the commands given by the user and directs them to the appropriate component to execute.

### Responsibilities:
- Reads and processes user commands.
- Determines which **Command** should be executed based on the userâ€™s input.
- Interacts with **InternshipList**, **Storage**, and **UI** to execute the required action.

## 6. Commands

The **Commands** package contains various actions that users can perform, such as adding, deleting, finding, or filtering internships. These commands are implemented as individual classes, each responsible for a specific action.

### Responsibilities:
- Each command interacts with **InternshipList** to modify or retrieve data.
- Handles operations like **Add**, **Delete**, **Find**, and **Filter**.
- Commands are processed by the **ParserComponent** and executed based on user input.

## **Implementation**
This section describes how some noteworthy features are implemented.
### Adding Internship
The ```add``` command allows users to add new internships and requires the following fields:
- Company
- Role
- Duration
- Allowance
- Skills

Example input: ```add c/Google r/SWE d/6 a/5000 s/Java, Python ```

#### Implementation Flow
1. The user enters an ```add``` command along with the required fields.
2. The parser receives the command and creates a new AddCommand instance.
3. Once the new instance is created, ```AddCommand.execute()``` is invoked.
4. The ```execute()``` method extracts the values from the user input, validates them, and processes them if needed.
5. A new internship object is then created and added to the Internship List.
6. The updated list is saved into ```storage```.
7. A confirmation message is then printed to the user via the ```Ui``` class.

The sequence diagram below showcases the flow of execution:

![addCommandSequence.png](images/addCommandSequence.png)

#### Error Handling
Additionally, ```AddCommand``` implements various exception handling to deal with errors.
+ ```EmptyInputException```: Thrown when no details are provided after "add"
+ ```InvalidInputFormatException```: Thrown when required fields are missing
+ ```NumberFormatException```: Caught by the Parser when allowance/duration are not integers

### Deleting Internship
The `delete` command allows users to remove an existing internship from the Internship List by specifying its index.

Example input: ```delete 1```
#### Implementation Flow
1. The user enters a `delete` command with an index.
2. The parser receives the command and creates a new `DeleteCommand` instance.
3. Once the new instance is created, `DeleteCommand.execute()` is invoked.
4. The `execute()` method extracts the index from the user input, validates it (ensuring that:
    - An index is provided.
    - The index is a valid integer.
    - The index is within the bounds of the Internship List), and processes it if valid.
5. The internship corresponding to the specified index is then removed from the Internship List.
6. The updated list is saved into `storage` (if persistence is implemented).
7. A confirmation message is then printed to the user via the `Ui` class.

The sequence diagram below showcases the flow of execution:

![deleteCommandSequence.png](images/deleteCommandSequence.png)

#### Error Handling
Additionally, `DeleteCommand` implements various exception handling to deal with errors.
- `EmptyInputException`: Thrown when no index is provided after "delete".
- `InvalidIndexException`: Thrown when the index given is out of bounds.
- `NumberFormatException`: Thrown when the provided index is not a valid integer.

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product Scope
#### Target User Profile
- Undergraduate students in Singapore seeking internships
- Tech-savvy users who prefer keyboard-driven applications
- Candidates applying to multiple internships simultaneously
