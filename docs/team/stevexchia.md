### Enhancements Implemented

**New Feature: Dynamic table formatting for listings**
- **What it does**: Displays all available internships in an adjustable table format that automatically resizes columns based on content
- **Justification**: Provides optimal information display regardless of entry length variations
- **Highlights**:
  - Implemented a responsive table formatter that calculates optimal column widths
  - Added truncation for very long entries with restrictions
  - Includes customisable display options through command parameters
- **Challenges**: Required solving complex string manipulation and console display problems
- **Code reference**: `TablePrinter.java`

**New Feature: Added serialization and local storage capability**
- **What it does**: Enables the application to save and load data locally, persisting user data between sessions
- **Justification**: Critical for a complete user experience, ensuring users don't lose their data
- **Highlights**: Required careful design of data structures and robust file error handling
- **Code reference**: `Storage.java`

**New Feature: Implemented entry editing functionality**
- **What it does**: Allows users to edit past entries with a guided, step-by-step interface
- **Justification**: Improves usability by allowing corrections without needing to delete and recreate entries
- **Highlights**: Designed an intuitive user flow that clearly indicates what aspects are being modified
- **Code reference**: `EditCommand.java`

**New Feature: Skill-based internship search**
- **What it does**: Allows users to find internships that match specific skills in their profile
- **Justification**: This targeted search capability helps users efficiently identify the most relevant opportunities
- **Highlights**:
  - Designed to scale with additional filters in future iterations
  - Includes case-insensitive search for better usability
- **Challenges**: Required careful design to ensure search results remained relevant while being comprehensive

**New Feature: Help Command System**
