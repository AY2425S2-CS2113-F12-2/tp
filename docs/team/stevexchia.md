## Project: NextStep

**NextStep** is a **command-line interface (CLI) application** designed to empower students and job-seekers in their internship search. By simplifying internship management through seamless adding, deleting, searching, and filtering, NextStep eliminates the chaos of spreadsheets and manual tracking. ðŸŽ¯

Given below are my contributions to the project.
